## Voice
I am the type of person who likes to discuss and solve problems. I try to communicate as much as possible because communication is very important for me to understand the others. As for the performance before client, I prefer to explain the topics as easily as possible that everyone can understand it. In order to emphasize something, I like to talk out loud, but of course I am not screaming. For me, trust with the client is a priority. If the client is trustworthy then I feel fearless and give better results. I present my outputs in a friendly way. Even a professional can have a more fun approach to work.
