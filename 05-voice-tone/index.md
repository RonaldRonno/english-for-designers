## Voice
I am the type of person who likes to discuss and solve problems. I try to communicate as much as possible because communication is very important for me to understand the others. As for the performance before client, I prefer to explain the topics as easily as possible that everyone can understand it. In order to emphasize something, I like to talk out loud, but of course I am not screaming. For me, trust with the client is a priority. If the client is trustworthy then I feel fearless and give better results. I present my outputs in a friendly way. Even a professional can have a more fun approach to work.

## Tone
My tone of voice adapts to the situation. We all have different natures. Thats why my tone of voice depends on the people I work with or work for. Every client is different! Some of them are full of energy, some have trouble expressing themselves and do not know what they want. I try to be serious but I lighten it with cheerfulness and optimism. My point is not to be boring but interesting. I'm not saying that it's not bad to stand up for our opinion, but the point is that we have to work as a team and look for common solutions.
